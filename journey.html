        <h2>Chapter 1: The Spark</h2>

        <p>
I love podcasts. My queue was always growing faster than I could listen. I tried
<a href="https://snipd.com" target="_blank" style="color: #3b82f6;">Snipd</a>—a fantastic
app that lets you adjust speed, create clips, and even chat with episodes. But even at faster
speeds, I was falling behind.
</p>


        <p>
            Then I remembered an article I'd read years ago about blind individuals who had trained themselves to
            comprehend audio at 5x speed. Not because of superhuman hearing, but through neuroplasticity and
            gradual training. <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-can-some-blind-people-process/" target="_blank" style="color: #3b82f6;">Scientific American covered this research</a>, and you can 
            <a href="https://rdouglasfields.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/speech16-syllables-a-sec.wav" target="_blank" style="color: #3b82f6;">hear
            samples of what 5x speed sounds like</a>.
        </p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p>
                The insight: Speed isn't just a feature—it's a trainable skill. What if I could build an app
                that trains your brain progressively, like Duolingo for listening?
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>
            I didn't want summaries—they lose the essence and stories. I wanted to consume the full content,
            just faster. And I wanted the training to be automatic, gradual, and science-backed.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 2: Act I - The Web App (That Didn't Work)</h2>

        <h3>The Plan</h3>

        <p>
            I'm technical, but not a developer. My instinct was to start simple: build a web app. Web technologies
            felt approachable. I thought an iOS app would be too complicated—Xcode, Swift, App Store submission...
            it all seemed intimidating.
        </p>

        <p>
            So I started with Claude Code to build a web-based podcast player with progressive speed training.
        </p>

        <h3>The Reality Check</h3>

        <p>
            We ran headfirst into CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) errors. Podcast RSS feeds are hosted on
            different domains, and browsers block direct access for security reasons. To play audio from those
            feeds, we'd need:
        </p>

        <ul style="margin-left: 30px; color: #475569;">
            <li>A proxy server to fetch the RSS feeds</li>
            <li>Backend infrastructure to stream audio</li>
            <li>Workarounds for every podcast host's different setup</li>
            <li>Dealing with HTTPS vs HTTP mixed content issues</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            We tried. We built proxy endpoints. We debugged CORS headers. But every fix revealed three new problems.
            What was supposed to be "simple" was becoming a backend engineering project.
        </p>

        <div class="lesson-box">
            <h4>💡 Lesson #1: Start with the platform that solves your core problems</h4>
            <p>
                I chose web because it felt "easier," not because it was the right platform for the job.
                Native iOS apps have built-in podcast playback, background audio, and lock screen controls.
                The web fights you at every turn for these features. I kept ignoring Claude's pleas to move to iOS for a lot longer than I should have!
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Chapter 3: Act II - The iOS Pivot</h2>

        <h3>The Intimidation Factor</h3>

        <p>
            After hours of wrestling with the web app and multiple gentle suggestions to switch to iOS, Claude suggested: "Why don't we build this as an iOS app?
            I can guide you through it."
        </p>

        <p>
            My immediate thought: <em>"I've never touched Xcode. I don't know Swift. The command line interface
            was already outside my comfort zone. This is crazy. I didn't want another big project."</em>
        </p>

        <p>
            But Claude's confidence was reassuring: "The tools are already built for this. Let me help you set up Xcode."
        </p>

        <h3>Day 1: Setting Up</h3>

        <div class="timeline">
            <div class="timeline-item">
                <div class="timeline-day">Hour 1-2: Xcode Installation</div>
                <p>
                    Downloaded Xcode (took forever—it's huge). Claude guided me through creating my first iOS project.
                    Bundle ID, deployment target, SwiftUI vs Storyboard... I had no idea what any of it meant.
                    But I followed the steps.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="timeline-item">
                <div class="timeline-day">Hour 3-4: First Success</div>
                <p>
                    We got "Hello World" running in the iOS Simulator. Seeing that app launch—even with just text on
                    screen—was magical. This was real. It was actually happening.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="timeline-item">
                <div class="timeline-day">Hour 5-8: Audio Playback</div>
                <p>
                    Claude wrote the audio service. We tested it with a direct podcast URL. When I heard audio
                    playing through the simulator, controlled by my app, I was hooked. This was feasible.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p>
                The pivotal moment: Realizing that the "hard stuff" (audio playback, increasing the speed but preserving the pitch, background processing,
                lock screen controls) was actually easier on iOS because Apple had already built the infrastructure.
                I just needed to wire it up.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Chapter 4: Act III - Building the MVP</h2>

        <h3>Day 2-3: Core Features</h3>

        <p>
            Once we had basic audio playback working, we moved fast. Claude would write code, I'd test it in the
            simulator, we'd iterate. The workflow felt like having an expert pair programmer who never got tired of my many requests for changes and explanations. Claude got good at testing stuff with unit tests and in the simulator, fixing things and then hand off to me.
        </p>

        <div class="timeline">
            <div class="timeline-item">
                <div class="timeline-day">Speed Progression Algorithm</div>
                <p>
                    This was the heart of the app. We implemented a system where speed increases gradually based on
                    listening time. The key insight: the increases has to be very gradual and deliberately unnoticeable. We used a positive version of the

                <p>
                    On iOS, we could fetch and parse RSS feeds directly—no proxy needed! We handled iTunes-specific
                    tags, HTML in descriptions, missing artwork, all the edge cases of podcast RSS feeds.

                    This is where iOS shines. With proper audio session setup and Now Playing Info Center integration,
                    we got background playback and lock screen controls working in hours, not days. Background playback was a key feature since we wanted users NOT to be looking at the phone.

            <p>
                We didn't build everything at once. We'd add one feature, test it thoroughly, then move to the next.
                Each working feature built confidence. Each bug fixed was a small win. Momentum compounds.

            <li><strong>Milestone celebrations:</strong> Confetti animation when you unlock 1.5x, 2.0x, etc.</li>
            <li><strong>Queue management:</strong> Add podcasts, build a listening queue, auto-advance</li>
            <li><strong>Per-episode memory:</strong> Resume playback position and speed for each episode</li>
            <li><strong>Training difficulty settings:</strong> Easy, Medium, Hard progression speeds</li>
            <li><strong>Beautiful UI:</strong> Dark theme, gradient accents, smooth animations. I used the brand style guide from Petra Coaching as the input for Claude here.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Chapter 5: Act IV - The Agent Gauntlet</h2>

        <h3>Evaluating Our Own Work</h3>

        <p>
            By Day 4, we had a working app. But was it good? I asked Claude to run the app and landing page through
            specialized AI agents—each with different expertise:
        </p>

        <div class="lesson-box">
            <h4>🧑‍🔬 User Researcher Agent</h4>
            <p><strong>Focus:</strong> User experience, pain points, messaging clarity</p>
            <p><strong>Top insight:</strong> "The #1 user objection—'Will I still understand what I'm listening to?'—isn't
            addressed anywhere. This barrier blocks 50%+ of conversions."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="lesson-box">
            <h4>💼 Executive Agent</h4>
            <p><strong>Focus:</strong> Market positioning, business strategy, scalability</p>
            <p><strong>Top insight:</strong> "You're positioning a feature (speed training) when you should position a
            platform (productivity multiplier). This is Duolingo for listening."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="lesson-box">
            <h4>⚙️ Engineer Agent</h4>
            <p><strong>Focus:</strong> Technical feasibility, architecture, edge cases</p>
            <p><strong>Top insight:</strong> "The core implementation is production-ready. The speed progression algorithm
            is clever. Minor concern: UserDefaults dictionary growth needs pruning strategy at scale."</p>
        </div>

        <h3>The Prioritization Exercise</h3>

        <p>
            The agents returned pages of feedback—both praise and improvements. Claude acted as orchestrator,
            synthesizing the feedback into ranked priorities:
        </p>

        <ol style="margin-left: 30px; color: #475569;">
            <li><strong>Critical:</strong> Add FAQ addressing comprehension anxiety (blocks 50% of users)</li>
            <li><strong>High Impact:</strong> Reframe messaging around productivity benefit, not speed mechanism</li>
            <li><strong>Medium Impact:</strong> Add social proof (testimonials) and quantified value props</li>
            <li><strong>Low Impact:</strong> Polish items (Open Graph tags, analytics, etc.)</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            We didn't try to fix everything at once. We tackled the critical items first, then high impact,
            then medium. This staging approach kept us from getting overwhelmed.
        </p>

        <div class="lesson-box">
            <h4>💡 Lesson #3: Get multiple perspectives, then prioritize ruthlessly</h4>
            <p>
                The agents each saw different things. The user researcher caught UX issues. The executive saw
                strategic positioning gaps. The engineer spotted technical debt. Together, they gave us a 360° view.
                But the key was prioritization—what moves the needle most right now?
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Chapter 6: Launch Prep</h2>

        <h3>Day 5: TestFlight and Landing Page</h3>

        <p>
            The final day was all about making it real:
        </p>

        <div class="timeline">
            <div class="timeline-item">
                <div class="timeline-day">Morning: App Store Connect</div>
                <p>
                    Set up the app in App Store Connect. Privacy policy, app description, keywords, age rating.
                    Claude provided a detailed guide with copy-paste-ready text. What could have taken hours took 30 minutes.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="timeline-item">
                <div class="timeline-day">Afternoon: Screenshots</div>
                <p>
                    Captured 5 app screenshots from the iPhone 17 Pro Max simulator. Fixed dimension issues
                    (App Store is picky about exact pixel sizes). Added them to App Store Connect. Claude went beyond and created believable data for our simulator screenshots which was a nice touch.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="timeline-item">
                <div class="timeline-day">Evening: Landing Page</div>
                <p>
                    Built a landing page on GitHub Pages. After our UX agent feedback, we completely transformed it—from
                    "Train Your Brain to Listen Faster" to "Reclaim 50+ Hours Per Year." Added FAQ section, testimonials,
                    visual journey, and benefit-focused messaging.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h3>The Before and After</h3>

        <p><strong>Before agent feedback:</strong></p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 30px; color: #475569;">
            <li>Tagline: "Train Your Brain to Listen Faster" (mechanism-focused)</li>
            <li>No FAQ section</li>
            <li>No testimonials or social proof</li>
            <li>Features listed generically</li>
            <li>No quantified value proposition</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>After transformation:</strong></p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 30px; color: #475569;">
            <li>Tagline: "Reclaim 50+ Hours Per Year" (benefit-focused)</li>
            <li>Comprehensive FAQ addressing comprehension concerns</li>
            <li>Beta tester testimonials</li>
            <li>Features reframed around outcomes</li>
            <li>Value props: 50+ hours saved, 2-5x speed, 100% comprehension</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong><br></strong></p><p>
            <strong>Estimated impact:</strong> Agents predicted 2-3x conversion rate improvement from these changes alone.

        <h2>Chapter 7: Lessons for Builders</h2>

        <div class="lesson-box">
            <h4>🎯 Lesson #1: Start Small, But Start</h4>
            <p>
                I didn't set out to build a perfect app. I set out to solve my own problem. The lesson from
                lean product development applies even more with AI: pick something you care about personally,
                build the simplest version that works, then iterate.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your first version will have bugs. Your design will be rough. That's okay. Ship it, get feedback, improve.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="lesson-box">
            <h4>🤝 Lesson #2: You Don't Need to Be an Expert—You Need a Partner</h4>
            <p>
                I was intimidated by iOS development. Xcode, Swift, App Store submission—it all seemed impossible.
                But Claude Code acted as my expert partner. I brought the vision and product sense. Claude brought
                the technical execution.
            </p>
            <p>
                The command line interface felt foreign at first, but Claude made it approachable. Every error message
                was explained. Every decision was justified. I learned by doing, with a safety net.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="lesson-box">
            <h4>🔄 Lesson #3: Embrace Pivots</h4>
            <p>
                We spent 2 days on the web app before pivoting to iOS. That felt like failure at the time.
                But those 2 days taught us what the core problem actually was. The pivot wasn't starting over—it
                was course-correcting with more information.
            </p>
            <p>
                Don't be married to your first approach. Be married to solving the problem.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="lesson-box">
            <h4>🎭 Lesson #4: Use Multiple Perspectives</h4>
            <p>
                The agent evaluation was a game-changer. Each agent (User Researcher, Executive, Engineer) saw things
                I missed. They disagreed with each other sometimes, which forced me to think critically about trade-offs.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can do this too: ask Claude to evaluate your work from different perspectives. "How would a UX
                designer view this?" or "What would a marketing expert say?" You'll get surprisingly insightful feedback.
            </p>

        <div class="lesson-box">
            <h4>⚡ Lesson #5: Velocity Compounds</h4>
            <p>
                Day 1 felt slow—just getting audio to play. But by Day 3, we were adding features in hours.
                By Day 5, we were polishing and shipping. Early momentum creates later velocity.
            </p>
            <p>
                The key: celebrate small wins. Every working feature is progress. Every bug fixed is a victory.
                Keep the flywheel spinning.

            <h4>💰 Lesson #6: Be Cost-Conscious—Use the Right Tool for Each Job</h4>
            <p>
                This project burned through over $100 in API credits before I realized I was using a sledgehammer
                for some thumbtack jobs. Anthropic offers three models with very different costs and capabilities.
                Learning to match the model to the task is projected to save 50-70% on costs going forward.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here's what I learned about model selection:
            </p>

            <div style="overflow-x: auto; margin: 20px 0;">
                <table style="width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 14px;">
                    <thead>

                            <td style="padding: 12px; border: 1px solid #e2e8f0;"><strong>Opus</strong></td>
                            <td style="padding: 12px; border: 1px solid #e2e8f0;">$15/MTok</td>
                            <td style="padding: 12px; border: 1px solid #e2e8f0;">Architecture decisions, multi-agent analysis</td>
                            <td style="padding: 12px; border: 1px solid #e2e8f0;">Anything Haiku or Sonnet can handle</td>
                        </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>
            </div>

            <p>
                <strong>The insight:</strong> Being explicit about cost constraints actually helped Claude make better decisions.
                When I said "use Haiku for simple tasks," it forced both of us to think clearly about what "simple" meant.
                Is updating a TestFlight link simple? Yes—use Haiku. Is designing a speed progression algorithm complex? Yes—use Sonnet.
            </p>
            <p>
                This constraint wasn't limiting—it was clarifying. Most tasks in software development are simple edits,
                file reads, and git operations. Using a $15/MTok model for those is like hiring a surgeon to apply a band-aid.
                Save your expensive models for when you truly need their reasoning power.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Quick rule:</strong> Default to Haiku unless you need complex reasoning. Your wallet will thank you,
                and you'll ship just as fast.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Chapter 7: Bonus Tip - Document Your Guidelines</h2>

        <p>
            One thing that saved me later: creating a <code style="background: #f1f5f9; padding: 2px 6px; border-radius: 4px;">claude.md</code>
            file with cost optimization and operating guidelines. Now when I start a new session, Claude reads that file and knows my preferences:
            which model for which task, when to ask before running expensive operations, how to batch simple tasks, how to show me a plan before doing any work, etc.</p>

        <p>
            Think of it as creating a "working agreement" with your AI partner. It makes future sessions faster and cheaper
            because the context is already set. You're not re-explaining your preferences every time.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 8: What's Next</h2>

        <p>
            As I write this, FastCast is in TestFlight beta. The next chapters:
        </p>

        <ol style="margin-left: 30px; color: #475569;">
            <li><strong>Beta testing:</strong> Get real user feedback, fix bugs, iterate on features</li>
            <li><strong>Positioning and pricing:</strong> Figure out the right market positioning and monetization strategy</li>
            <li><strong>App Store launch:</strong> Submit for full App Store review, go global</li>
            <li><strong>Growth:</strong> Learn what resonates, double down on what works</li>
        </ol>

        <p><br></p><p>
            But the real journey has been this: proving to myself that the intimidation was worse than the reality.
            Building software with AI isn't about being a developer. It's about being a builder—someone with a vision
            and the determination to iterate with a good and patient partner until it's real.
        </p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p>
                You don't need to know how to code. You need to know what problem you're solving and be willing
                to work through the messy middle. The tools are there. The help is there. The only question is:
                what are you going to build?
            </p><p><br></p><p>When the cost of building solutions is dropping rapidly, the value of asking good questions is even more important.</p>

            If you're reading this and thinking "I could never do that," I felt the same way 5 days ago.
            Here's how to start:
        </p>

        <ol style="margin-left: 30px; color: #475569;">
            <li><strong>Pick a problem you personally experience.</strong> The best products come from scratching your own itch.</li>
            <li><strong>Start with Claude Code.</strong> It's free to try. Open a conversation and say: "I want to build [X]. I've never coded before. Where should I start?" I got my feet wet with this great <a href="https://ccforpms.com">Claude Code for PMs<a/> which uses Claude Code to teach.</li>
            <li><strong>Expect false starts.</strong> Our web app didn't work. That's normal. Pivots aren't failures—they're learning. Stay fixed on the goal. Stay flexible on the path to get there.</li>
            <li><strong>Ship early.</strong> Get something working, show people, get feedback. Perfect is the enemy of shipped.</li>
            <li><strong>Use the agent evaluation trick.</strong> Ask Claude to review your work from multiple perspectives. You'll catch blindspots.</li>
        </ol>

                and more about problem-solving persistence. You can follow the journey at
