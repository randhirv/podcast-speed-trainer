# Privacy Policy for FastCast

**Last Updated: January 28, 2026**

## Introduction

FastCast ("we," "our," or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard information when you use our iOS application.

## Information We Collect

FastCast operates with a privacy-first approach. All your data is stored locally on your device.

### Data Stored Locally on Your Device

- **Podcast Subscriptions**: RSS feed URLs you add to your library
- **Playback Preferences**: Your speed progression settings and training schedule
- **Progress Data**: Episode playback positions and completion status
- **Statistics**: Your listening time, time saved, and speed milestones achieved
- **Queue Information**: Episodes you've added to your playback queue

### Network Activity

FastCast accesses the internet only for:
- **Fetching Podcast Data**: Downloading RSS feeds from podcast hosting services you choose to subscribe to
- **Streaming Audio**: Playing podcast episodes directly from the hosting servers

We do NOT collect, transmit, or store any of this data on our servers.

## Data We Do NOT Collect

- Personal identification information (name, email, phone number)
- Location data
- Device identifiers beyond what iOS requires for app functionality
- Usage analytics or tracking data
- Advertising identifiers

## Third-Party Services

FastCast directly connects to:
- **Podcast RSS Feeds**: We fetch episode information from podcast hosting services (e.g., Libsyn, Buzzsprout, etc.) based on the feeds you add
- **Audio Streaming**: We stream audio files directly from podcast hosts

We do not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.

## Data Retention

All app data is stored exclusively on your device using iOS's standard data storage (UserDefaults and local file system). Your data persists until you:
- Delete the app
- Clear the app data through iOS Settings
- Manually remove podcasts or episodes from the app

## Children's Privacy

FastCast does not knowingly collect any information from children. The app is rated 4+ and contains no age-inappropriate content. Parents should supervise their children's use of the app.

## Your Rights

Since all data is stored locally on your device, you have complete control:
- **Access**: View all your data within the app's Statistics and Settings screens
- **Modify**: Change any preferences or settings at any time
- **Delete**: Remove podcasts, clear queue, or delete the app entirely

## Data Security

Your data security is important to us:
- All data is stored using iOS's secure local storage mechanisms
- Network connections use HTTPS encryption when available
- No data is transmitted to our servers or third parties (except for fetching podcast content you explicitly request)
